1.	PROJECT IDEA<br>
We have designed a project to predict the future stock price using an already available dataset with the help of machine learning.   


2.	PROJECT DESCRIPTION<br>
Trying to predict the stock market is an enticing prospect to data scientists motivated not so much as a desire for material gain, but for the challenge. We see the daily up and downs of the market and imagine there must be patterns we, or our models, can learn in order to beat all those day traders with business degrees. 
We learned a ton of Python to create a statistical model to predict the future price of a given share using the previous datasets available on the internet.


3.	TECHNOLOGIES AND REFERENCES<br>
Websites, Softwares and Open Source Libraries have all played a major role in the making of this project report, especially the following ones:


*	Anaconda	
*	Numpy
*	Jupyter	
*   Matplotlib
*   Python 3.7	
*	Pandas
*	Data Visualisation	
*	Datetime
*	Animation	
*	KNN Algorithm


4.	PROJECT OUTCOMES<br>
This project helped us in understanding the basics of KNN algorithm as well as machine learning and data visualisation in an interactive way (animation) using Python.
